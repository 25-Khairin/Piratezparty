# Vulnerable VM for practice (or just VM based stuff...)

-   [CommandoVM](https://github.com/mandiant/commando-vm) - a fully customizable, Windows-based security distribution for penetration testing and red teaming.
-   [FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) - a collection of software installations scripts for Windows systems that allows you to easily setup and maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine (VM). FLARE VM was designed to solve the problem of reverse engineering tool curation and relies on two main technologies: Chocolatey and Boxstarter. Chocolatey is a Windows-based Nuget package management system, where a "package" is essentially a ZIP file containing PowerShell installation scripts that download and configure a specific tool. Boxstarter leverages Chocolatey packages to automate the installation of software and create repeatable, scripted Windows environments.
-   [TraceLabs OSINT VM](https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/osint-vm) | [See It In Action](https://youtu.be/jjK0nvmOeUA) - The Trace Labs team created a specialized OSINT VM specifically to bring together the most effective OSINT tools and customized scripts we saw being used during our Search Party CTF’s. Inspired by the infamous Buscador VM, the Trace Labs OSINT VM was built in a similar way, to enable OSINT investigators participating in the Trace Labs Search Party CTF’s a quick way to get started and have access to the most popular OSINT tools and scripts all neatly packaged under one roof.
